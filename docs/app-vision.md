# Name

- The app is called TeamTime.

# Users

- Users are software development teams who do mob programming.

# Example scenario 1

- Alice, Bob, Cathy, and Dave are a team of developers.
- Alice, Cathy, and Dave meet to do mob programming for 90 minutes.
- Alice opens MobBot on her phone.
- The first screen shows a list of the team members with checkmarks next to each member, an editable field that says that 10 minutes is the rotation time, and a Continue button.
- Alice unchecks Bob to record that he is absent, then clicks Continue.
- The main screen appears with a big countdown timer set to the rotation time in minutes and seconds, a Start button, and the names of the three team members, in shuffled order, with the first name highlighted.
- The team member whose name is first clicks Start. The timer begins counting down and the button name changes to Stop.
- The member whose name is first starts typing code as dictated by the other team members.
- One minute before time is up, the app beeps a warning and the timer begins to blink.
- When time is up, an alarm sounds, the timer stops, and the button name changes to Rotate.
- The team member who was typing stops and clicks Rotate.
- The list of names rotates to put the next team member first and highlighted. The timer resets to the rotation time. The button name changes to Start.
- The process repeats.

# Coding notes

- Use setInterval() to implement the timer.
- Use AudioContext to play sounds.
- Define and import a MockAudioContext in unit tests.
